# Grppy: gRPC Python Library
Grppy (pronounced "Grippy") is library to help make dealing with gRPC files a heck of a lot easier in Python. 
It provides:

* In-memory file generation (so no more running the `python -m grpc-tools` commands)
* Client / Server models for both development and production

**Note that this is a brand new project, so it is not available just yet.**
