# Grppy: gRPC Python Library
Grppy (pronounced "Grippy") is library to help make dealing with gRPC files a heck of a lot easier in Python. 
It provides:

* In-memory file generation (so no more running the `python -m grpc-tools` commands)
* Client / Server models for both development and production

**Note that this is a brand new project, so it is not available just yet.**

## Credits & Maintenance

Grppy is currently maintained by [Daniel Starner](https://www.danstarner.com) and uses the [Lark Parser](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) to generate the syntax trees under the hood. This project wouldn't be possible without their awesome library!
